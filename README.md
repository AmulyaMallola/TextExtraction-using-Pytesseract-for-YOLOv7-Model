# TextExtraction-using-Pytesseract-for-YOLOv7-Model


Python-tesseract is a Python tool designed for optical character recognition (OCR), which allows you to extract and interpret text from images. It serves as an interface to Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. This tool can function as a standalone script, making it easy to use Tesseract for text extraction from various image formats like jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and more, using libraries like Pillow and Leptonica. When used as a script, Python-tesseract will display the recognized text instead of saving it to a file.
